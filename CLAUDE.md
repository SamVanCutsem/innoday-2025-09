# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is an Innovation Day project repository for September 2025. The repository is currently in its initial setup phase with a minimal structure.

## Repository Structure

The repository currently contains:
- `.claude/agents/` - Custom Claude Code agent definitions
  - `front-end-developer.md` - Frontend development specialist agent
  - `ui-ux-designer.md` - UI/UX design specialist agent
- Basic project files (README, LICENSE, .gitignore)

## Custom Agents

This repository includes two specialized agents that can be used proactively:

### Frontend Developer Agent (`frontend-developer`)
- Specializes in React 19, Next.js 15, and modern frontend architecture
- Masters client-side and server-side rendering patterns
- Expertise in performance optimization, accessibility, and design systems
- Use for UI components, frontend issues, and React/Next.js development

### UI/UX Designer Agent (`ui-ux-designer`)
- Focuses on design systems, accessibility-first design, and user research
- Masters design tokens, component libraries, and inclusive design
- Expertise in user flows, interface optimization, and cross-platform design
- Use for design systems, wireframes, and interface optimization

## Development Setup

This repository appears to be configured for .NET development based on the .gitignore file, but no specific .NET projects or configuration files are present yet.

## Current State

The repository is in early development phase with:
- No build configuration files present
- No source code or project structure established
- Ready for project setup and initial implementation

## Notes

Since this is an Innovation Day project, the development approach may be rapid prototyping and experimentation-focused.
